# Use Bootstrap Tables in gitbooks & epub

## Gitbook
Most of `kableExtra` tricks will work in `bookdown` except those requiring [`bootstrap`](http://getbootstrap.com/). By default, `rmarkdown` won't load `bootstrap` for you on gitbook as it's not necesary. In `kableExtra`, I used the [bootstrap 3.3.7 customization tool](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/customize/) and made a customized css copy. You can load it by setting `options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)`. 

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)

mtcars[1:5, 1:5] %>%
  kable(booktabs = T) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover", "bordered", "condensed"),
    latex_options = c("striped")
  ) %>%
  column_spec(1, color = "red") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", "Group A" = 2, "Group B" = 3))
```

**One very important note** here is that by default bookdown loads the gitbook table css on start up. It has some conflicts with `bootstrap` tables. As a result, some features like `hover` won't be able to work by default. To solve this problem, you need to use the latest version of `bookdown` (version >= 0.7.21) and turn off the `table_css` option under `bookdown::gitbook` in `_output.yml`

```
bookdown::gitbook:
  table_css: false
```

## Epub
Right now, it's impossible to load addition CSS through HTML dependency (due to a setting in rmarkdown). I will file an issue in `rmarkdown` and see if this is something that can be changed. In the mean time, to use bootstrap tables in Epub, you will have to manually load [this stylesheet](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/blob/master/inst/bootstrapTable-3.3.7/bootstrapTable.min.css) by putting it to a CSS file (such as "style.css") and load it in `_output.yml`. For example,

```
bookdown::epub_book: 
  stylesheet: style.css
```
