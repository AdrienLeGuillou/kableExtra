People may find some features in `kableExtra`, such as hovering/striped rows are not working in `radix`. The reason is that `kableExtra` relies on `bootstrap` stylesheet to do these jobs while `radix` doesn't have those css load. Therefore you need to tell `kableExtra` to load the table css for you by setting `options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)`. 

```{r, echo = T}
library(kableExtra)
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = T)  

kable(iris[1:6, ], caption = "kable with kableExtra") %>%
  kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = F,
                position = "left") %>%
  add_header_above(c("numerical" = 4, "categorical" = 1)) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T) %>%
  row_spec(0, italic = T)
```


Comparing with other table options

```{r, echo = T}
kable(iris[1:6, ], caption = "Basic kable")
```

```{r, echo = T}
rmarkdown::paged_table(iris)
```

# Appendix
Here is a screenshot of how table looks like if you don't turn on the `kableExtra.html.bsTable` option (with the same code). In fact, the only part that breaks is the `striped` and `hover` option. :P
